<!-- Check the post with markdownlint-->

Welcome to the fourth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroupâ€™s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### Zemeroth

I finally found time to work on adding ability icons and descriptions to #Zemeroth!

Also, improving ZGui a little bit: better color handling, better offsets, layered widget layout, etc.
