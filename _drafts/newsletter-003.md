Welcome to the third issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Sulis][sulis] - a Turn-Based RPG

![chest and inventory with items](/assets/newsletter-003/sulis-inventory.png)

[Sulis][sulis] is a Role Playing Game (RPG) with turn based, tactical combat,
deep character customization and an engaging storyline.
The game has been built from the ground up with modding
and custom content in mind.
Currently supported on Windows and Linux platforms.

The game is currently fully playable
and includes the first act of The Twin Expanse,
an old school RPG campaign in the vein of classic games
such as _Baldur's Gate_,
but mixing in modern elements from titles like
_Divinity: Original Sin_ and _Pillars of Eternity_.

The core game engine as well as the campaign
are still under heavy development.
Users are encouraged to [file issues with bugs][sulis-issues],
feature requests, or any other feedback.

![flaming fingers spell demonstration](/assets/newsletter-003/sulis-battle.png)

Features:

- Cross platform native binaries, currently [built for Windows and Linux][sulis-releases]
- Multiple campaigns with over 8 hours of playtime,
  featuring both handcrafted and procedural content.
- We are designing a detailed and fully realized world and story - check out
  the [Lore page][sulis-lore].
- Designed with modding in mind - although more work still needs
  to be done in this area.
- A powerful 2D graphics engine with zoom, scalable UI, HiDPI support,
  and a swappable graphics backend.
- Runs on very modest hardware - even software renderers
  (although at a reduced frame rate).

![ability tree gui](/assets/newsletter-003/sulis-abilities-tree.png)

The GPLv3-licensed [source code is hosted on GitHub][sulis-src].
Sulis is written in Rust, with scripting in Lua and most data files in the YAML format.

### [Ferris Fencing][ferris-fencing]

![Two crabs fencing on a 1D map](/assets/newsletter-003/ferris-fencing.png)

[Ferris Fencing][ferris-fencing] is a live tournament in which
player-programmed bots combat each other on a [RISC-V] virtual machine.
It is a showcase of [CKB-VM], a simple implementation of the RISC-V instruction set,
written in the Rust programming language.

[Here're the rules][ferris-fencing-rules].

The Ferris Fencing tournament is not yet live,
but fencers may begin building their bots and testing them locally.
Instructions are in the [GitHub repo][ferris-fencing-repo].

A multiplayer piano using UDP sockets that can be played using computer keyboard, in the terminal.

> Hi! A few years back I wrote a piano game for the terminal in Rust when I did not know much about general good code practices. However, recently I've been learning more on how to write good code and so, I spent the last 2 weeks trying to refactor the codebase along with adding a multiplayer feature.

### splines-3.0.0: ‚Äústroke‚Äù B√©zier support

**TODO**: img?

by [@phaazon]

[splines], a crate to handle spline interpolation, just got released in version 3.0.0. That version adds support for stroke B√©zier interpolation, which is a B√©zier interpolation but allows you to break the handles (instead of the regular 180¬∞ angle formed by the handle with the `Interpolation::Bezier` mode).

spline-editor got a patch to allows you to try stroke B√©zier. Just put some points and set them all to B√©zier interpolation (use the space key). Then select a point and press space again to switch to stroke B√©zier. You can move each handle independently from the other.
