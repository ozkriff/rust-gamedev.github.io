Welcome to the third issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Sulis][sulis] - a Turn-Based RPG

![chest and inventory with items](/assets/newsletter-003/sulis-inventory.png)

[Sulis][sulis] is a Role Playing Game (RPG) with turn based, tactical combat,
deep character customization and an engaging storyline.
The game has been built from the ground up with modding
and custom content in mind.
Currently supported on Windows and Linux platforms.

The game is currently fully playable
and includes the first act of The Twin Expanse,
an old school RPG campaign in the vein of classic games
such as _Baldur's Gate_,
but mixing in modern elements from titles like
_Divinity: Original Sin_ and _Pillars of Eternity_.

The core game engine as well as the campaign
are still under heavy development.
Users are encouraged to [file issues with bugs][sulis-issues],
feature requests, or any other feedback.

![flaming fingers spell demonstration](/assets/newsletter-003/sulis-battle.png)

Features:

- Cross platform native binaries, currently [built for Windows and Linux][sulis-releases]
- Multiple campaigns with over 8 hours of playtime,
  featuring both handcrafted and procedural content.
- We are designing a detailed and fully realized world and story - check out
  the [Lore page][sulis-lore].
- Designed with modding in mind - although more work still needs
  to be done in this area.
- A powerful 2D graphics engine with zoom, scalable UI, HiDPI support,
  and a swappable graphics backend.
- Runs on very modest hardware - even software renderers
  (although at a reduced frame rate).

![ability tree gui](/assets/newsletter-003/sulis-abilities-tree.png)

The GPLv3-licensed [source code is hosted on GitHub][sulis-src].
Sulis is written in Rust, with scripting in Lua and most data files in the YAML format.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Bumpy terrain with a rivers and trees](/assets/newsletter-003/veloren.png)

[Veloren][veloren] is an open-world, open-source multiplayer voxel RPG.
The game is in an early stage of development, but is playable.

This month [a v0.4 version was released](https://veloren.net/devblog-37)
and a [player survey results was published][veloren-survey].

Some of the Octobers' improvements:

- lots of bugfixes and optimizations;
- improved erosion, rivers and water flow physics;
- user interface improvements;
- improved game lore;
- RFC procedure for 0.5 development.

[PF Sandbox][pf-sandbox] by [@rukai] is a platform fighter sandbox featuring:
in game Fighter and Stage Editor, replays, and TAS tools.

### [Antorum][antorum]

![Antorum screenshot: a few human characters, a few rats and an inventory UI](/assets/newsletter-003/antorum.jpeg)

[Antorum][antorum] is a multiplayer RPG where players build their characters
and fight against the growing threats on the isle.
The game server is authoritative and written in Rust,
while the client is written in Unity/C#.

This month, [@dooskington] published a bunch of devlogs:

- [#6 "Items And Inventory"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/6);
- [#7 "Grubbnet"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/7);
- [#8 "The Editor"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/8);
- [#9 "The Editor, Pt. 2"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/9);
- [#10 "Terrain Sync"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/10).

------

As described in the [7th devlog](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/7),
an initial version of a "[grubbnet]" crate was published.

It's a lightweight TCP client/server
for writing networked applications and games.
It abstracts socket code, keeps track of connections,
and delivers everything back to the developer in a nice list of events.
In addition to handling network events
(such as client connects and disconnects),
handling incoming packets is as easy as grabbing an iterator
over the incoming packet queue.

It's the same networking crate that the Antorum game server uses
under the hood.

### [Ferris Fencing][ferris-fencing]

![Two crabs fencing on a 1D map](/assets/newsletter-003/ferris-fencing.png)

[Ferris Fencing][ferris-fencing] is a live tournament in which
player-programmed bots combat each other on a [RISC-V] virtual machine.
It is a showcase of [CKB-VM], a simple implementation of the RISC-V instruction set,
written in the Rust programming language.

[Here're the rules][ferris-fencing-rules].

The Ferris Fencing tournament is not yet live,
but fencers may begin building their bots and testing them locally.
Instructions are in the [GitHub repo][ferris-fencing-repo].

### [Will it dissolve?][dissolve]

![Dissolve gameplay demo](/assets/newsletter-003/dissolve.gif)

["Will it dissolve?"][dissolve] is a small puzzle game
for ["Open Jam 2019"](http://openjam.io)
where you have to prepare the level so that it will
automatically convert and dissolve in the future.

Programmed with the help of the [Tetra engine][tetra].
[The source code is available here][dissolve-src].

### [Garden Devlog: October][garden-october]

![Garden screenshot: a tree, leaves, water and ruins](/assets/newsletter-003/garden.jpeg)

[Garden][garden-itch] is an upcoming game centered around
growing realistic plants.

The following changes were made since the last devlog:

- Improved flowers were added.
- The plant simulation code is almost finalized,
  and developers will be able to start adding new species soon.
- The procedural ruin generation was improved:
  no more floating concrete chunks.

[Watch the video demo here](https://twitter.com/logicsoup/status/1190754460575961089).

Also, a new design plan was created:

- The main objective is to restore the luscious ecosystem
  in a polluted wasteland.
  The player will have to continuously figure out how to handle different
  environmental constraints to keep trees growing, collect enough fruit
  and figure out what to do with them, and unlock new goals and flora.
- But for players who are interested in wild, goalless plant growth,
  there‚Äôll also be a sandbox mode.
  As one progresses in the main game and ‚Äúunlocks‚Äù more trees,
  playing around with creating flourishing jungle troves will be possible.

To stay informed of smaller updates, screenshots, and new devlogs,

### splines-3.0.0: ‚Äústroke‚Äù B√©zier support

**TODO**: img?

by [@phaazon]

[splines], a crate to handle spline interpolation, just got released in version 3.0.0. That version adds support for stroke B√©zier interpolation, which is a B√©zier interpolation but allows you to break the handles (instead of the regular 180¬∞ angle formed by the handle with the `Interpolation::Bezier` mode).

spline-editor got a patch to allows you to try stroke B√©zier. Just put some points and set them all to B√©zier interpolation (use the space key). Then select a point and press space again to switch to stroke B√©zier. You can move each handle independently from the other.
